# ESP8266 Hall Magnetic Sensor Project

#### Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to use a Hall Effect sensor with an ESP8266 microcontroller to detect the presence of a magnetic field. It prints the status of the magnetic field (detected or not detected) to the Serial Monitor.

#### Components Needed
- **ESP8266 Microcontroller**
- **Hall Effect Sensor Module**
- **Jumper Wires**
- **Power Supply**

#### Circuit Setup
1. **Connecting the Hall Effect Sensor to ESP8266:**
   - **Sensor OUT Pin:** Connect to a GPIO pin on ESP8266 (e.g., D1).
   - **VCC:** Connect to 3.3V or 5V pin on ESP8266.
   - **GND:** Connect to GND pin on ESP8266.

#### Instructions
1. **Setup:**
   - Upload the provided Arduino code to the ESP8266 using the Arduino IDE.
   - Open the Serial Monitor to view the status of the magnetic field detection.

2. **Testing:**
   - After uploading the code, bring a magnet close to the Hall Effect sensor.
   - Observe the Serial Monitor output to see if the magnetic field is detected.

#### Applications
- **Proximity Sensing:** Use in applications where proximity to magnets or magnetic fields needs to be detected.
- **Security Systems:** Integrate into security systems for detecting door/window openings.
- **Automation:** Trigger actions based on the presence or absence of magnetic fields.

#### Notes
- **Sensor Orientation:** Ensure proper alignment of the sensor and magnet for accurate detection.
- **Power Supply:** Ensure the ESP8266 and the Hall Effect sensor operate within their specified voltage ranges.
- **Interference:** Minimize electromagnetic interference in the vicinity of the sensor for reliable operation.
